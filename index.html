        'What Should I Roll?' is a website designed by <a>TeyStar</a> to quickly 
        give you a class for your next character, built around what the current 
        party already contains and the campaign setting.
    </p>
    
    <p>My Party Contains:</p>
    <ul  ng-repeat="partyMember in party track by $index">
         <li>
             {{partyMember.name}}
         </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="ui submit button">This Is My Current Party</div>
    
    <form class="ui form" ng-submit="createPartyMember(newPartyMember)">
        <div class="field">
            <select ng-model="newPartyMember.id">
                <option value="">Choose A Class</option>
                <option value="0">Fighter</option>
                <option value="1">Cleric</option>
                <option value="2">Rogue</option>
                <option value="3">Wizard</option>
            </select>
            <button class="ui submit button">Submit</button>
        </div>
    </form>
    
    
    <p id="disclaimer">
        'What Should I Roll?' is not 100% accurate but will almost always give
        a good class suggestion.  Its accuracy diminishes when players use 3rd
        party materials or class archtypes.  Think about these variables and try
        to find an archtype within the suggested class for best results in these
        circumstances.  Always try to make something that will be fun to play!
